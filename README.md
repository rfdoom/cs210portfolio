1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project creates a menu application for users to access a grocer. The user is able to search the grocer's inventory for items and receive the amount of said item the grocer has in stock.

2. What did you do particularly well?

The menu was implemented well with the least amount of code possible at my current level of C++. I believe the while loop was used perfectly to maintain the menu throughout multiple queries.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I'm sure this code could have been made using much more concise code. I see that my current work is very lengthy and doesn't use as many built-in functionalities that C++ offers. I also should be leaving better comments throughout my projects.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most difficult ones to wrap my head around were the code lines for opening, writing to, and closing a file in C++. I had to look on sites like StackOverflow and YouTube to figure out how to go about doing this. I highly recommend those sites to anyone trying to code.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Almost all of the concepts transfer over to different projects, like loops and reading from files.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

There is a lot of open space available to make the app more robust with features. As it is now, it is mostly simple enough to be understood by anyone with a similar beginner level of C++ expertise.
